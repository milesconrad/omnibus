# omnibus
A general purpose discord bot that keeps track of user's roles, makes captions for images/gifs, and plays youtube videos in voice channels

Along with the packages in `requirements.txt`, you will also need to make sure you have imagemagick installed on your machine. As it stands, the bot is using os.system() to process the images.

This bot is programmed to be run on linux, so unfortunately I don't have any help for getting it running on windows.
